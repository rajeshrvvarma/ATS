## October 16, 2025 — Clean Professional Design (Completed)

### ✅ Completed Tasks
- Removed 10 custom gradient background classes from `tailwind.config.js`
- Replaced all `bg-gradient-*` page backgrounds with `bg-slate-900` / `bg-slate-800`
- Replaced all `text-gradient-*` with standard Tailwind text colors (e.g., `text-blue-400`)
- Kept Tailwind built-in gradient utilities only for buttons/accents
- Updated 20 files across pages, components, and config

### Impact
- Consistent, professional dark theme across the site
- Simpler styling system; easier maintenance
- Further performance improvements due to reduced CSS complexity

### Verification
- Ran codebase search to confirm no `text-gradient-*` remain
- Checked that only built-in `bg-gradient-to-*` utilities are used
- Visual QA on key pages (home, catalog, detail, landing pages)

### References
- See `CLEAN_DESIGN_COMPLETE.md` for full details and verification commands

## October 17, 2025 — Module Management System Implementation (Completed)

### What Was Implemented
Added a comprehensive **module management system** to control visibility and lifecycle of the 102 learning modules in the catalog without deleting data.

### Technical Implementation
- **Status Field**: Added optional `status` property to module schema in `modules.json`
  - Values: `"active"` (visible), `"hidden"` (temporarily removed), `"archived"` (permanently retired)
  - Backward compatible: Modules without status field default to `"active"`

- **Filtering Logic**: Implemented client-side filtering across all module-consuming components
  - `ModuleCatalog.jsx`: Filters to show only active modules in catalog grid
  - `HomePage.jsx`: Filters featured modules on landing page
  - `ModuleDetailPage.jsx`: Blocks direct access to hidden/archived modules (shows 404)
  - Filter logic: `m => !m.status || m.status === 'active'`

- **Management Tools**: Created PowerShell scripts for bulk operations
  - `scripts/update-module-status.ps1`: Bulk update module status by ID
  - `scripts/list-modules.ps1`: Report modules grouped by status with colored output

### Files Modified
- `src/pages/ModuleCatalog.jsx` (lines 73-97): Added status filtering during module fetch
- `src/pages/HomePage.jsx` (lines 837-850): Added active module filter
- `src/pages/ModuleDetailPage.jsx` (lines 19-32): Added status check to block hidden modules

### Files Created
- `MODULE_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md`: 300+ line comprehensive documentation
- `scripts/update-module-status.ps1`: Bulk status update tool
- `scripts/list-modules.ps1`: Module reporting tool with summary statistics

### Impact
- **Flexibility**: Can temporarily hide modules without deleting data
- **Control**: Three-tier status system for different use cases
- **Tools**: Command-line scripts for non-technical bulk operations
- **Compatibility**: Existing 102 modules continue working without modification

### Verification
- Build test: ✅ PASS (npm run build successful)
- Module filtering: Active modules display correctly in catalog
- Detail page blocking: Hidden/archived modules show "Module Not Found"
- Script validation: PowerShell tools tested with sample module IDs

### Next Steps
- Use scripts to hide deprecated modules as needed
- Mark old/outdated modules as "archived" for record-keeping
- Consider adding admin UI for module management in future phase
