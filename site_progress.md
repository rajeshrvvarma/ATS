### What has been implemented so far
- Complete vibrant, gradient-based redesign of the entire site using Tailwind CSS and custom utility classes.
- All pages, forms, and components updated to remove white backgrounds and ensure a consistent, colorful UI/UX.
- AnimatedBackground component with 12+ gradient variants applied to all major and landing pages.
- All headings, buttons, and cards refactored to use new gradient and dark theme utilities.
- Systematic audit of all user-facing pages and components for compliance with the new design system.
- Creation of `VIBRANT_DESIGN_REFERENCE.md` as a comprehensive guide for the new design system.
- Public folder checked and confirmed to have no styling issues.

### Next steps
- Update minor internal components (e.g., StudyGroups.jsx and any other low-priority components) to ensure full compliance with the vibrant design system.
- Monitor and update any new pages or components using the reference guide to maintain consistency.
- When the above tasks are completed, update this document with a new entry and date, summarizing the completed work.
