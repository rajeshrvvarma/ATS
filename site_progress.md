## October 16, 2025 — Clean Professional Design (Completed)

### ✅ Completed Tasks
- Removed 10 custom gradient background classes from `tailwind.config.js`
- Replaced all `bg-gradient-*` page backgrounds with `bg-slate-900` / `bg-slate-800`

- Further performance improvements due to reduced CSS complexity

### Verification
- Ran codebase search to confirm no `text-gradient-*` remain
- Checked that only built-in `bg-gradient-to-*` utilities are used
- Visual QA on key pages (home, catalog, detail, landing pages)

### References
- See `CLEAN_DESIGN_COMPLETE.md` for full details and verification commands
