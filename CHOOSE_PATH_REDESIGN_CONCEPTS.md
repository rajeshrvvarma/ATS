# 🎨 "Choose Your Path" Section - Redesign Concepts

## 📋 **CURRENT ANALYSIS**

**What we have now**:
- View selection interface (Complete, Smart Grouping, Learning Journey)
- Static cards with basic program information
- 3-step process: Choose view → See programs → Enroll
- Limited engagement and conversion optimization

**Issues identified**:
- Too many steps to see actual programs
- View selection adds friction instead of value
- Not personalized or goal-oriented
- Missing urgency and social proof elements
