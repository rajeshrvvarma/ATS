## **🎯 CURRENT GOAL: Implement Dedicated Course Pages**

### **Inspiration & Strategy:**
Following **QualityThought.in** model where each course has its own dedicated page:
- `qualitythought.in/cyber-security-training/`
- `qualitythought.in/multi-cloud-engineer-training/`
- `qualitythought.in/testing-tools-training-hyderabad/`

### **Why This Approach:**
1. **SEO Benefits:** Each course gets individual URL and ranking
2. **Professional Positioning:** Matches industry standards
3. **Better UX:** Focused course information without distractions
4. **Marketing:** Direct links for ads and social media
5. **Conversion:** Course-specific enrollment flows
