# PhonePe Migration Summary

## What Changed

This document summarizes the migration from Razorpay to PhonePe payment integration.

### Files Modified

#### Backend (Netlify Functions)
- **Added**: `netlify/functions/phonepe-initiate.js` - Creates PhonePe payment transactions
- **Added**: `netlify/functions/phonepe-verify.js` - Verifies payment status
- **Added**: `netlify/functions/phonepe-callback.js` - Handles payment callbacks/webhooks
- **Added**: `netlify/functions/payment-status.js` - Returns order status for polling
- **Removed**: All `razorpay-*.js` functions

#### Frontend Services
- **Added**: `src/services/phonepe.js` - PhonePe client service
- **Added**: `src/services/payments.js` - Payment polling helper
- **Removed**: `src/services/razorpay.js`

#### Payment Components
Note: legacy `EnhancedEnrollmentModal.jsx` has been replaced by the canonical `ModernEnrollmentModal.jsx`.
The modern modal consolidates enrollment and payment UI, including UPI/PhonePe steps and deep-link/QR support.
Files to inspect:
- `src/components/ModernEnrollmentModal.jsx` (canonical enrollment UI)
- `src/components/UPIQRCode.jsx` (UPI QR rendering helper)

#### Payment Pages
- **Modified**: `src/pages/PaymentSuccessPage.jsx`
  - Added URL parameter parsing for `mtid` (merchant transaction ID)
  - Implements payment status polling
  - Shows verification progress and receipt details

- **Modified**: `src/pages/AccountActivationPage.jsx`
  - Replaced Razorpay integration with PhonePe
  - Uses redirect flow instead of modal

- **Modified**: `src/pages/EnrollUsPage.jsx`
  - Updated test payment flow to use PhonePe

#### Other Components
- **Modified**: `src/components/VideoCourse.jsx`
  - Course enrollment now uses PhonePe for paid courses

- **Modified**: `src/pages/PrivacyPage.jsx`
  - Updated payment processor mention from Razorpay to PhonePe

### Technical Changes

#### Payment Flow
**Before (Razorpay)**:
1. Create order via `razorpay-order` function
2. Open Razorpay modal on same page
3. Handle success/failure in modal callbacks
4. Verify payment signature
5. Redirect to success/failure page

**After (PhonePe)**:
1. Call `phonepe-initiate` function
2. Redirect to PhonePe hosted payment page
3. User completes payment on PhonePe
4. PhonePe redirects back to success page with `mtid`
5. Success page polls `payment-status` until confirmed
6. PhonePe sends webhook to `phonepe-callback`

#### Data Storage
- Orders stored in Firestore `orders` collection
- Webhook events stored in `webhooks_phonepe` collection
- Payment status tracked through order documents

#### Environment Variables
**Removed**:
- RAZORPAY_KEY_ID
- RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET

**Added**:
- PHONEPE_MERCHANT_ID
- PHONEPE_SALT_KEY
- PHONEPE_SALT_INDEX
- PHONEPE_BASE_URL
- FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT

### Benefits of Migration

1. **Better Mobile Experience**: PhonePe's hosted page is optimized for mobile payments
2. **Reduced Frontend Complexity**: No need to handle payment UI in our app
3. **Enhanced Security**: Payment processing happens on PhonePe's secure servers
4. **Better UPI Support**: Native UPI integration with PhonePe ecosystem
5. **Webhook Reliability**: Improved webhook handling with idempotency

### Breaking Changes

- Payment modal replaced with redirect flow
- Different success page behavior (polling vs immediate display)
- New environment variable requirements
- Firestore collections for order tracking

### Migration Benefits

- All existing forms continue to work (contact, enrollment inquiries)
- Payment success/failure pages handle both old and new flows
- No changes needed to user authentication or course access
- Existing admin dashboard functionality preserved
