# Archived Module System

## What This Was
This folder contains the original "modular learning" system that was designed before pivoting to the premium course strategy.

## Original Concept
- Individual modules (₹99 each) as standalone learning units
- Students could buy specific skills instead of full courses
- Modular approach to cybersecurity education

## Why Archived
- **Business Strategy Change**: Pivoted to premium ₹20K courses for better revenue
- **Course Structure**: Modules are now internal course components (chapters), not standalone products
- **Focus**: Homepage now focuses exclusively on 3 premium courses for clarity

## Files Included
- `modules.json` - Complete module catalog (100+ modules)
- `pages/` - ModuleCatalog.jsx, ModuleDetailPage.jsx
- `data/modules.js` - Module data processing
- `scripts/` - Module management scripts
- `analysis/` - Module analysis HTML reports

## Future Use
These files can be:
1. **Deleted** if module system is permanently abandoned
2. **Repurposed** for internal course content structure in LMS
3. **Referenced** for creating course curricula

## Decision Date
Archived on: October 17, 2025
Decision: Focus on premium courses only for revenue optimization
